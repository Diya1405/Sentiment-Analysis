## 📘 **Machine Learning Concepts Used**

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **ML techniques**:

### **1. Tokenization**
- Splits sentences into words/tokens for analysis.

### **2. TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Converts text into numerical vectors based on word importance.

### **3. Sentiment Classification Model**
- Uses a trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes) to classify sentiment.

### **4. Preprocessing Techniques**
- Stopword removal, lowercasing, and punctuation cleaning.

### **5. Model Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy** — overall correctness.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** — better quality evaluation.
- **Confusion Matrix** — tracks prediction performance.
